    Use the sidebar on the left to choose between:

    * **Historical Data App**: For analyzing players and building squads when you have season performance data (scores, goals, regularity, etc.).

    * **New Season App**: Designed for new leagues or when detailed historical data is unavailable. This app uses your subjective estimations for player performance, potential, regularity, and goals.
